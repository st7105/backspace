Backspace is a self-hosted, open-source Discord alternative: a Discord-style chat
platform you run on your own hardware. Spaces, channels, roles, voice and video,
screen sharing, direct messages, friends, file sharing, and message search. On top
of that, **server-to-server federation** lets independent Backspace instances talk
to each other while each stays under its own control.

It is **free and open source** under the **GNU AGPL-3.0**, and dual-licensed: a
commercial license is available if the AGPL doesn't fit your use. See
[License](#license) for the details.

> **Project status** <a name="project-status"></a>
> Backspace 1.0. Stable, self-hostable, and actively developed.

## What makes Backspace different

Self-hosted chat usually forces a trade-off: gaming-grade voice and video, *or* a
polished Discord-style experience, *or* federation between independent servers.
Rarely all three, and rarely with the fine-grained media controls people expect.

Backspace does all three at once:

- **Voice and video with a real control surface.** This goes past a screen-share
  button. Choose resolution, frame rate, codec (VP9 or hardware H.264), and
  bitrate; set independent 0-200% volume for every person and every screen-share;
  RNNoise noise suppression; a live connection inspector (bitrate, codec, ping,
  packet loss, jitter); and a per-tile badge showing each stream's measured
  resolution and frame-rate. Screen sharing goes up to 4K/120fps within admin-set
  bounds.
- **Federation, not a walled garden.** Run your own instance and peer it with
  others for cross-instance friends, DMs, calls, and presence. Each server stays
  independently owned, and requests are HMAC-authenticated.
- **A complete platform, not a demo.** Role-based permissions with per-category
  and per-channel overrides, friends and group DMs, inline playable media,
  moderation with audit trails, search, a desktop app, and an installable mobile
  PWA, all in the warm, calm "Aether Drift" interface.

You own the server, the data, and the network it federates into.

- Account management: password change and account deletion with safeguards

## Installation

The intended way to deploy Backspace is the **interactive installer**. It
configures everything (`.env`, secrets, HTTPS, optional voice) and brings the
stack up for you. It **auto-detects your environment** and picks one of three
deployment modes. The default "All-in-One" (below) needs nothing but a host and
a domain, but if ports 80/443 are already taken (an existing reverse proxy, a
tunnel, another app) the installer steers you to the right mode instead of
dead-ending. See [Deployment modes](#deployment-modes) for the full picture.

By default the installer **pulls a prebuilt multi-architecture image** from the
GitHub Container Registry (`linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`), so weak or ARM boxes
(a Raspberry Pi) skip the heavy local build. It falls back to building from
source automatically if the image can't be pulled.

### Requirements

- A **Linux host** (VPS, VM, or home server) with **Docker** and **Docker Compose**.
- A **domain name** for your instance. In the default All-in-One mode it must
  point at the host's public IP (Caddy obtains HTTPS certificates for it
  automatically); behind your own reverse proxy or a tunnel it points at that
  edge instead. See [Deployment modes](#deployment-modes).
- The ability to open the firewall ports in step 2 (All-in-One), or a reverse
  proxy / tunnel already terminating HTTPS for you.

### 1. Run the installer

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheZwiss/backspace.git
cd backspace
./install.sh
```

The installer walks you through everything interactively:

- asks for your domain,
- generates a secure `JWT_SECRET`,
- optionally enables voice/video (sets up the bundled LiveKit server),
- writes `.env` (and `livekit.yaml` if voice is enabled),
- starts all services with Docker and configures automatic HTTPS via Caddy.

### 2. Open the firewall ports

Open these on the host (and, if it's behind a router, port-forward them to the host):

| Port | Proto | When | Purpose |
|------|-------|------|---------|
| `80` | TCP | **Always** | HTTP. Caddy's automatic-HTTPS (ACME) challenge + redirect to HTTPS |
| `443` | TCP | **Always** | HTTPS. Web app, REST API, WebSocket, and LiveKit signaling (proxied) |
| `3478` | UDP | If voice enabled | TURN. NAT traversal for WebRTC |
| `7881` | TCP | If voice enabled | WebRTC TCP fallback (clients that can't use UDP) |
| `50000–60000` | UDP | If voice enabled | WebRTC media (voice / video / screen-share streams) |

Without voice, you only need `80` and `443`. The voice ports are required only
when you enable LiveKit. LiveKit's own signaling port (`7880`) stays internal.
It's reverse-proxied through Caddy on `443`, so you do **not** forward it.

> **Do this together with DNS, ideally before (or right after) running the
> installer.** Caddy gets your HTTPS certificate from Let's Encrypt the first
> time the stack starts, which requires your domain to resolve to this host
> **and** ports `80`/`443` reachable from the internet. If they aren't ready
> yet, that's fine. Caddy keeps retrying, and HTTPS comes up automatically once
> DNS and the ports are in place.

### 3. Create your admin account

Open `https://your-domain` and register. **The first account created becomes the
instance admin**. There is no default username or password.

If the page doesn't load over HTTPS, it's almost always DNS or ports `80`/`443`
not being reachable from outside. Check `docker compose logs caddy` for
certificate errors. (The installer's health check confirms the app is up
internally, not that the certificate was issued.)

### Backups & restore

The app takes automatic SQLite snapshots (before every migration, on a schedule,
and on demand via `./backup.sh`). Restore from a snapshot with `./restore.sh`.
See [`docs/systems/deployment.md`](docs/systems/deployment.md) for the full
backup/restore and image-pinning guide.

### Manual setup (advanced, optional)

The installer above is the supported path. If you'd rather configure everything
by hand, you can skip it and drive Docker Compose directly, but then DNS,
`.env`, secrets, voice config, and the same firewall ports from step 2 are your
responsibility:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheZwiss/backspace.git
cd backspace

cp .env.example .env
# Set DOMAIN, and generate a secret:
echo "JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)" >> .env

docker compose up -d
```

The stack runs three services via Docker Compose:

| Service     | Role                                              |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `backspace` | The app (API + WebSocket + built web client) on internal port `3000` |
| `caddy`     | Reverse proxy with automatic HTTPS for your `DOMAIN` (ports `80`/`443`) |
| `livekit`   | Voice/video server; optional, enabled with `COMPOSE_PROFILES=voice` |

## Deployment modes

Homelabs differ. Backspace supports three deployment modes from **one installer**,
which auto-detects which one fits and, in non-obvious cases, asks. The mode is
recorded as `DEPLOY_MODE` in `.env`; you can also set it up front for a
non-interactive install (`DEPLOY_MODE=proxy ./install.sh`).

| Mode | When | HTTPS handled by | Voice |
|------|------|------------------|-------|
| **`allinone`** (default) | Ports 80/443 are free and you have a domain | The bundled **Caddy** (automatic Let's Encrypt) | Yes, with UDP media ports open |
| **`proxy`** | You already run a reverse proxy (nginx, Traefik, Caddy, Nginx Proxy Manager, SWAG…) | **Your** reverse proxy | Yes, if you also proxy `/livekit` and open the media ports |
| **`tunnel`** | You expose the box through a tunnel (Cloudflare Tunnel, Tailscale…) | The **tunnel** provider | No, WebRTC/UDP can't traverse a tunnel |

In `proxy` and `tunnel` mode the bundled Caddy is **not** started; instead the app
is published on **`127.0.0.1:APP_PORT`** (loopback only, never exposed directly)
for your proxy or tunnel to forward to. This is driven by a small overlay,
`docker-compose.proxy.yml`, which the installer wires in for you by setting
`COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:docker-compose.proxy.yml` in `.env`, so every
later `docker compose …` command in the directory keeps working with no `-f`
flags. The installer auto-picks a free `APP_PORT` (3000/8080 are often taken);
override it with `APP_PORT=…`.

The installer prints ready-to-paste config for your mode at the end. The
canonical snippets are below.

### Mode 2: behind your own reverse proxy

The app answers plain HTTP on `127.0.0.1:APP_PORT`; your proxy terminates TLS and
forwards to it. Every snippet already includes the three things people get wrong:
**WebSocket upgrade** (chat and live events won't work without it),
**`X-Forwarded-*`** (the server runs with `trustProxy` and needs the real client
scheme/IP), and a **body-size limit** matching `MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE` (default 100 MB).

Replace `chat.example.com` and `8080` with your domain and `APP_PORT`.

If your public port is not 443 (a home connection where the ISP blocks 80 and
443, say), put the port in `DOMAIN` itself: `DOMAIN=chat.example.com:1443`. That
is the host clients type, and every URL the instance advertises is built from
it. Make your proxy listen on that port and pass the `Host` header through
unchanged; the snippets below already do (`$http_host` in nginx, since `$host`
drops the port). Only `proxy` mode supports this: the bundled Caddy needs 80
and 443 for certificates, and a tunnel always serves on 443 at its edge.
Federation with a port in `DOMAIN` is not supported yet.

**nginx.** The `map` goes in `http { }` once; the `server` block per site:

```nginx
map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade { default upgrade; '' close; }

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name chat.example.com;

    # ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/chat.example.com/fullchain.pem;
    # ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/chat.example.com/privkey.pem;

    client_max_body_size 100m;        # match MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Host              $http_host;   # not $host: it drops the port
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP         $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For   $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host  $http_host;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade    $http_upgrade;        # WebSocket
        proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;  # WebSocket
        proxy_read_timeout 3600s;
        proxy_send_timeout 3600s;
    }

    # Voice only: forward LiveKit signaling (strips the /livekit prefix):
    # location /livekit/ {
    #     proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:7880/;
    #     proxy_http_version 1.1;
    #     proxy_set_header Host       $http_host;
    #     proxy_set_header Upgrade    $http_upgrade;
    #     proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
    # }
}
```

**Caddy** (if you run your own; it handles WebSocket and `X-Forwarded-*` itself):

```caddy
chat.example.com {
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8080
    request_body { max_size 100MB }

    # Voice only:
    # handle_path /livekit/* { reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:7880 }
    # handle           { reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8080 }
}
```

**Traefik** (file provider; Traefik handles WebSocket automatically):

```yaml
http:
  routers:
    backspace:
      rule: "Host(`chat.example.com`)"
      entryPoints: [websecure]
      service: backspace
      tls: { certResolver: letsencrypt }
  services:
    backspace:
      loadBalancer:
        servers:
          - url: "http://127.0.0.1:8080"
  # Voice only: add a higher-priority router + stripPrefix middleware for
  # PathPrefix(`/livekit`) → http://127.0.0.1:7880.
```

#### GUI proxies (Nginx Proxy Manager, SWAG, etc.)

You can't paste a config file into a point-and-click proxy, so set these fields
by hand. In **Nginx Proxy Manager**, add a **Proxy Host**:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Domain Names** | `chat.example.com` |
| **Scheme** | `http` |
| **Forward Hostname / IP** | `127.0.0.1`, but **if NPM runs in Docker**, `127.0.0.1` is NPM's *own* container. Use the host's LAN IP, or `host.docker.internal` with `extra_hosts: ["host.docker.internal:host-gateway"]` on the NPM container. |
| **Forward Port** | your `APP_PORT` (e.g. `8080`) |
| **Websockets Support** | **ON** (required; chat/live events break without it) |
| **Block Common Exploits** | fine to leave on |
| **SSL tab** | request a Let's Encrypt cert and enable **Force SSL** |
| **Advanced tab** | add `client_max_body_size 100m;` (match `MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE`) |

The same three ideas apply to any GUI proxy: forward to the app's host+port,
enable WebSocket support, and raise the request-body limit.

### Mode 3: behind a tunnel (Cloudflare, Tailscale)

Same loopback publish as Mode 2, but the tunnel daemon on the host reaches
`127.0.0.1:APP_PORT` and no inbound ports are opened at all. For **Cloudflare
Tunnel** (`cloudflared`):

```yaml
# ~/.cloudflared/config.yml
tunnel: <YOUR-TUNNEL-ID>
credentials-file: /root/.cloudflared/<YOUR-TUNNEL-ID>.json

ingress:
  - hostname: chat.example.com
    service: http://127.0.0.1:8080
  - service: http_status:404
```

```bash
cloudflared tunnel route dns <YOUR-TUNNEL-ID> chat.example.com
```

Two tunnel-specific caveats, both handled by the installer:

- **Upload cap.** Cloudflare (free/pro) hard-caps request bodies at **100 MB**, so
  the 100 MB default would let large uploads fail *at the edge*. In `tunnel` mode
  the installer sets `MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE=94371840` (90 MB) with headroom. Don't raise
  it back above ~100 MB behind Cloudflare.
- **No voice.** Voice/video is **WebRTC over UDP**, which a tunnel can't carry, so
  it's disabled in `tunnel` mode. If you need voice, use Mode 2 (reverse proxy)
  with the media ports opened, or All-in-One.

### Voice per mode

Voice/video (LiveKit) needs its **UDP media ports** reachable from clients.
These carry the actual audio/video and never pass through your HTTP proxy or
tunnel:

| Port | Proto | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `3478` | UDP | TURN. WebRTC NAT traversal |
| `7881` | TCP | WebRTC TCP fallback |
| `50000–60000` | UDP | WebRTC media (voice / video / screen-share) |

- **All-in-One.** Voice works once those ports are open/forwarded. LiveKit
  *signaling* is proxied through Caddy on 443 (`/livekit`); port `7880` stays
  internal, never forwarded.
- **Reverse proxy.** You must **also** route `/livekit` to `127.0.0.1:7880` (see
  the commented lines in the snippets) **and** open the media ports above.
- **Tunnel.** Voice does **not** work (UDP can't traverse the tunnel). This is a
  known, unavoidable limitation, not a misconfiguration.

### Updating a running instance

From the install directory:

```bash
./update.sh          # update, with one confirmation prompt
./update.sh --check  # see whether an update exists, changing nothing
```

`update.sh` takes a database snapshot, refreshes the checkout where that is
possible, fetches the new image (pulling or rebuilding to match how you
installed), and restarts only the `backspace` container. It then waits for the
healthcheck **and verifies the running version actually changed**. If either
fails, it puts back the image you were on and tells you what happened. A
no-op update is detected and skips the restart entirely, so nobody gets
dropped from a voice call for nothing.

Signed-in admins can see the running version and whether an update exists under
**Instance Settings, Updates**, which also shows the exact command for their
install.

If you do not have `update.sh` yet (it ships from 1.0.5), take a snapshot with
`./backup.sh`, then:

```bash
git pull                              # refresh compose files / install.sh / docs

# Prebuilt-image installs (the default):
docker compose pull backspace && docker compose up -d backspace

# From-source installs (a fork, or BACKSPACE_BUILD=true):
docker compose up -d --build backspace
```

Because `COMPOSE_FILE` lives in `.env`, these commands automatically use the
right compose files in every mode, with no `-f` flags to remember. A redeploy
briefly restarts the `backspace` container (clients reconnect automatically).

> **Name the `backspace` service and do not pass `--remove-orphans`.** If you run
> other containers in the same compose project, Compose will suggest that flag,
> and following it deletes them.

## Development

Requirements: **Node.js 20 or newer** and **pnpm 10**. The `.nvmrc` file selects
Node 24, which is the active LTS and the version the Docker image runs. CI runs
the suite on both Node 20 and Node 24, so a Node 20 host still works, but Node 20
reached end of life in April 2026 and is not what a fresh checkout picks up.
Newer majors generally work but are not part of the test matrix.

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env          # set JWT_SECRET (openssl rand -hex 32)
pnpm dev                       # API server on :3005, Vite dev server on :5173
```

On Windows PowerShell, confirm Node 20 or newer and use the native copy command:

```powershell
node --version
pnpm install
Copy-Item .env.example .env
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

Paste the generated value after `JWT_SECRET=` in `.env`, then start both
development servers with `pnpm dev`. Use `node --version` to confirm the active
version if pnpm reports an engine warning. This covers the server and web dev
servers; building the Electron desktop app still expects a POSIX shell (macOS or
Linux).

> **Server/web only?** `pnpm install` also builds the desktop app's native
> keyboard-hook module (`uiohook-napi`), which needs a C++ toolchain
> (`make`, `g++`, `python3`). If those are missing it now **warns and continues**,
> and the server and web client don't need it. Install a build toolchain
> (Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install build-essential python3`) only if you're
> building the **desktop** app. And to *self-host*, use the Docker installer
> above; it never touches the desktop package.

Run the halves separately if you prefer:

```bash
pnpm dev:server   # API + WebSocket on :3005
pnpm dev:web      # Vite dev server on :5173
```

Build everything for production (shared types → server → web):

```bash
pnpm build
```

In production the server serves the built web client directly.

## Configuration

All configuration is via environment variables (see [`.env.example`](.env.example)).
The most important:

| Variable             | Required | Default     | Description |
|----------------------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| `DOMAIN`             | yes      | none        | Public domain name of your instance |
| `JWT_SECRET`         | yes      | none        | Auth signing secret, **min 32 chars** (`openssl rand -hex 32`) |
| `DEPLOY_MODE`        | no       | `allinone`  | `allinone` \| `proxy` \| `tunnel`, see [Deployment modes](#deployment-modes) |

## Voice & Video

Voice, video, and screen sharing require a [LiveKit](https://livekit.io/) server.
The Docker Compose file bundles one. Enable it by setting these in `.env`:

```bash
COMPOSE_PROFILES=voice
LIVEKIT_URL=wss://your-domain
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=your-api-key
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=your-api-secret
```

Enabling voice also requires opening the WebRTC ports (`3478/UDP`, `7881/TCP`,
`50000–60000/UDP`). See [Open the firewall ports](#2-open-the-firewall-ports).

Without LiveKit configured, everything else works fully (text, federation, DMs,
uploads, search); only voice/video channels won't connect.

## Federation

Backspace instances can peer with each other so users on different servers can
become friends, DM, and call across instances, while each instance stays
independently owned and operated. Peering is mutual and authenticated with
HMAC-signed requests; identities are addressed as `username@instance`. Manage
peers from the **Connections** panel in settings. The protocol is documented in
[`docs/systems/federation.md`](docs/systems/federation.md) and
[`docs/systems/client-federation.md`](docs/systems/client-federation.md).

## Desktop App

The Electron desktop app wraps the web client and adds a system tray, native
notifications, global keybinds, and activity detection.

### Download

Grab the installer for your platform from the
[**latest release**](https://github.com/TheZwiss/backspace/releases/latest):

| Platform | File | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| Windows | `Backspace-<version>.exe` | Universal installer (x64 + arm64). SmartScreen may warn on first run; choose "More info" → "Run anyway". Auto-updates. |
| macOS | `Backspace-<version>-arm64.dmg` (Apple Silicon) / `Backspace-<version>-x64.dmg` (Intel) | Builds are ad-hoc signed but **not notarized**, so Gatekeeper blocks the first launch. Open it once, dismiss the warning, then go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security** and click **Open Anyway** next to the Backspace message. On macOS 14 and earlier, right-click the app → **Open** → **Open** works instead. Auto-update is not available on macOS yet, so check the releases page for new versions. |
| Linux | `Backspace-<version>-x86_64.AppImage` / `-arm64.AppImage`, or `.deb` (`amd64` / `arm64`) | AppImage auto-updates; `.deb` installs update via new releases. |

On first launch the app asks for your instance URL. Enter the address of the
Backspace server you use (e.g. `https://chat.example.com`).

Linux users can also build and install the Flatpak manifest locally. See
[`flatpak/README.md`](flatpak/README.md) for the commands and sandbox details.

### Building from source

```bash
cd packages/desktop
pnpm build:ts    # compile TypeScript
pnpm dev         # run in development
pnpm build       # package for distribution
```

Cross-platform builds are produced for Windows, macOS, and Linux. See
[`docs/systems/desktop.md`](docs/systems/desktop.md).

## Mobile

Backspace works on mobile today. Just open your instance in a phone browser.
The UI has a dedicated touch layout (bottom navigation, swipe gestures, and
full-screen views), and because it ships as an installable **PWA** you can use
your browser's **Add to Home Screen** to install it as a standalone app: its own
icon, no browser chrome, and an offline message queue that flushes when you
reconnect.

Native **iOS and Android app-store apps are planned**, once the project gains
traction and the funding for the developer-program licenses is secured. Until
then, the installable PWA is the supported way to run Backspace on a phone.

## Architecture

Backspace is a TypeScript monorepo managed with pnpm workspaces.

```
packages/
  shared/   - Shared types, permission bits, constants
  server/   - Fastify API + WebSocket server, Drizzle/SQLite, federation
  web/      - React 18 SPA (Vite, Tailwind, Zustand)
  desktop/  - Electron wrapper
```

| Layer        | Technology |
|--------------|------------|
| Server       | Node.js 20+, Fastify 4, TypeScript (strict) |
| Database     | SQLite (better-sqlite3) + Drizzle ORM |
| Auth         | JWT + bcrypt |
| Frontend     | React 18, Vite 8, Tailwind CSS 3, Zustand 5 |
| Voice/Video  | LiveKit |
| Media        | sharp (thumbnails), Cheerio (embeds) |
| Desktop      | Electron 43 |
| Deployment   | Docker Compose + Caddy (auto-HTTPS) |

Every subsystem has a dedicated specification under
[`docs/systems/`](docs/systems/): database schema, REST API, WebSocket
protocol, federation, permissions, voice, the design system, and more. **These
are the reference for how Backspace works**; start there if you want to
understand or extend a subsystem.

## FAQ

**Is Backspace a self-hosted Discord alternative?**
Yes. It gives you a Discord-style experience (spaces, channels, roles, voice,
video, screen sharing, DMs, friends) that you run entirely on your own server, so
you own the data and set the rules.

**How is it different from Revolt, Spacebar, Matrix, or Mumble?**
See the full [comparison](docs/comparison.md), including where each of those is the
better choice. In short: Backspace pairs a Discord-style client with a serious
voice and screen-share control surface and optional server-to-server federation.

**Does it have screen sharing and high-quality video?**
Yes. Screen sharing goes up to 4K/120fps within admin-set bounds, with per-stream
codec, bitrate, and resolution controls, RNNoise noise suppression, and a live
connection inspector. Voice and video use [LiveKit](https://livekit.io/) and are
optional; text, federation, DMs, and everything else run fully without them.

**Can I self-host it on a Raspberry Pi?**
Yes. The installer pulls a prebuilt multi-architecture image (amd64 and arm64), so
low-power and ARM boxes skip the heavy local build.

**Is it really open source?**
Yes, under the GNU AGPL-3.0. A separate commercial license is available for cases
the AGPL does not fit. Every released version stays available under the AGPL.

**Does it work on mobile?**
Yes, as an installable PWA with a dedicated touch layout. Native iOS and Android
apps are planned.

**What does "federation" mean here?**
Independent Backspace instances can peer with each other so users on different
servers can be friends, DM, and call across instances, while each server stays
independently owned. Requests between servers are HMAC-authenticated.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please read [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md)
first. Backspace is a single-owner project, so all contributors sign a
[Contributor License Agreement](CLA.md), a one-time comment on your pull
request, handled automatically by a bot. **You keep the copyright to your
contribution** and grant the maintainer (Jannis Braun) an exclusive license to
it, which is what lets Backspace be offered under both the AGPL and a commercial
license. You also receive a perpetual license to reuse the specific code you
wrote in your own other projects.

## Privacy

Backspace tracks nobody. There is no analytics, no crash reporting, and nothing
phones home on its own. The one exception is opt-in: an admin can let their
instance send me a once-a-day hello with rounded counts (people, messages, the
version, whether voice and federation are on) and the country the request came
from. No names, no message content, no addresses of any kind. It stays off until
an admin says yes, in Instance settings or with `TELEMETRY=on` at install time,
and can be turned off again at any time. Everything that comes back is published
as open data on the [insights page](https://thezwiss.github.io/backspace/insights/).
What is sent, how it is stored and for how long is documented in
[`docs/systems/telemetry.md`](docs/systems/telemetry.md).

## Security

If you discover a security vulnerability, please **do not** open a public issue.
Report it privately via a GitHub security advisory on this repository. See
[`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md). We'll work with you on a fix and coordinated
disclosure.

### Security and supply chain

Every change is scanned automatically before and after it lands. Results are
published to this repository's Security tab.

| What | Tool | When |
|------|------|------|
| Static analysis of the TypeScript | CodeQL | every pull request, every push to `main`, weekly |
| Known vulnerabilities in dependencies | OSV-Scanner | every pull request, every push to `main`, weekly |
| Secrets, across the full git history | gitleaks | every pull request, every push to `main`, weekly |
| Infrastructure and container config | Trivy | every pull request, every push to `main`, weekly |
| Dependency licenses | Trivy | every pull request, every push to `main`, weekly |
| The published container image | Trivy | on every image publish |
| Repository security posture | OpenSSF Scorecard | every push to `main`, weekly |
| A running instance | OWASP ZAP baseline | every push to `main`, weekly |
| Dependency and base image updates | Dependabot | weekly |

Supporting practice: every GitHub Action is pinned to a full commit SHA rather
than a tag, every job runs on a hardened runner with egress auditing, and
workflow permissions are granted per job instead of repository-wide. Published
images carry a software bill of materials and build provenance.

Findings are triaged rather than accumulated. Anything dismissed carries a
written reason, recorded in
[`docs/systems/security-scanning.md`](docs/systems/security-scanning.md), which
also documents the scan policy, the known gaps, and the deployment-time settings
a self-hoster should check.

## License

Backspace is **free and open source software**, licensed under the
**[GNU Affero General Public License v3.0](LICENSE)** (`AGPL-3.0-only`).

In plain terms:

- Yes: self-host, run, study, and modify it, including commercially and inside a business.
- Yes: redistribute it and your changes under the same AGPL-3.0 license.
- Note: if you run a **modified** version as a network service, you must offer your
  users its complete corresponding source (AGPL § 13). Backspace makes this easy:
  set `BACKSPACE_SOURCE_URL` to your fork so the in-app "Source code" link points
  at what you actually run.
- Note: preserve the copyright and license notices.

**Commercial license.** If the AGPL doesn't fit (embedding Backspace in a
closed-source product, offering it as a managed service without publishing your
modifications, or an organization that can't use AGPL software), a separate
commercial license is available on request. See
[`LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.md`](LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.md).

> **Our open-source commitment.** Every released version of Backspace is, and
> will remain, available under the AGPL-3.0. The Contributor License Agreement
> exists to enable a commercial license and optional enterprise add-ons, **not**
> to take the open-source edition private. If this project is ever abandoned, or
> the open-source edition is relicensed under non-free terms, the community stays
> free to fork the last AGPL release.
