# Security Scanning & Supply-Chain Assurance

Automated, continuous scanning wired into GitHub Actions. This document is the
reference for what runs, where results go, and the one-time settings a maintainer
must enable. **Current state: enforcing**, with one documented exception. The
scanners in `security.yml` fail the job on a finding the tiered policy says must
block. The published-image scan in `docker-publish.yml` is the exception and is
still report-only, for the measured reason in "The image scan is the exception"
below.

## Workflows

> **gitleaks findings** surface in the workflow's job log and PR summary — the
> `gitleaks` job does not upload SARIF, so secret hits do **not** appear under
> Security → Code scanning (unlike the OSV / Trivy / CodeQL / Scorecard jobs).

## Tiered policy

- **Always block:** gitleaks secret hit; OSV/Trivy fixable HIGH/CRITICAL; Trivy
  disallowed license.
- **Advisory (SARIF → Security tab):** CodeQL alerts; OSV/Trivy unfixable or
  medium/low; Scorecard.

Code-level gates (OSV, Trivy, gitleaks) block via workflow exit codes. CodeQL
merge-blocking, Dependabot alerts, and native secret-scanning are GitHub *settings*
— see the checklist below.

### How enforcement is actually wired

Turning this on was not a matter of deleting `continue-on-error`. Two things had to
be true first, and both were measured rather than assumed.

**Trivy exits 0 in SARIF mode whatever it finds.** Removing `continue-on-error`
alone would have looked like enforcement while enforcing nothing. The config and
license jobs carry `exit-code: '1'` plus `severity: 'HIGH,CRITICAL'`; the exit code
is what blocks, and the severity filter is what keeps it aligned with the tiered
policy above.

**All thirteen remaining OSV findings are fixable**, and five are HIGH, so a plain
flip would have turned `main` red and blocked every pull request. `osv-scanner.toml`
resolves that as a **ratchet rather than a waiver**: it lists exactly the backlog
that existed at flip time, one entry per finding, each with the reason and the
version that fixes it. Anything not in that file fails the job, so a newly
introduced vulnerability blocks while the documented backlog stays visible.

Every entry carries `ignoreUntil = 2026-12-01`. **A waiver with no expiry is how a
backlog becomes permanent.** When that date passes these findings come back and
block, which forces the upgrade decision instead of letting it rot. That is
deliberate, and it means `main` can go red on that date if nobody has acted. The
fix is to do the upgrades, not to push the date.

### The image scan is the exception

`docker-publish.yml`'s Trivy image scan stays report-only, but the backlog behind
that decision is now mostly gone. The findings the scan reports are not the ones
the dependency pass covers: Trivy inspects the image's real `node_modules` and its
installed OS and Node packages, while OSV reads the lockfile, so the two see
different things.

**Measured 2026-09-03 against an image built from `main`: 20 fixable
HIGH/CRITICAL.** Seventeen of them had nothing to do with the application. They
came from two package managers that sat in the runtime image without ever running:

- `pnpm` 10.34.3, which the runtime stage installed itself via
  `corepack prepare`, along with the copy of `brace-expansion`, `ip-address` and
  `tar` bundled inside pnpm's own distribution. Those bundled copies are not
  reachable from `pnpm-lock.yaml`, so no `pnpm.overrides` entry could have fixed
  them. Thirteen findings.
- `npm`, which `node:24-slim` bundles, with its own vendored `brace-expansion`,
  `ip-address` and `tar`. Four findings.

The runtime stage installs nothing from a registry. `node_modules` is copied
wholesale from `deps` and the CMD starts `node` directly, so neither manager was
ever invoked. The `Dockerfile` now removes both from that stage (the `deps` and
`builder` stages still need pnpm and keep it). **The count after that change is 3.**

The three that remain are one cluster, all reached through Fastify 4:
`fastify` 4.29.1 (CVE-2026-25223), `@fastify/static` 7.0.4 (CVE-2026-15074) and
`find-my-way` 8.2.2 (CVE-2026-47219). Every fixed version Trivy names is in a
later major: Fastify 5.7.2, `@fastify/static` 10.1.1, `find-my-way` 9.7.0, and
`@fastify/static` 10 requires Fastify 5 anyway. There is no fix inside the 4.x
line, so clearing these is the Fastify 5 migration and its plugin ecosystem, not a
version bump. That is a code change with a real blast radius and it belongs in its
own pass.

So the job stays report-only for now. Making it blocking today would fail every
release publish until the Fastify migration lands, and holding security fixes
behind a scanner backlog is the exact inversion this project already decided
against when the release track was changed from one release at the end to a patch
per landed track. **When the Fastify migration lands, re-measure, and if the count
is zero add `exit-code: '1'` and drop `continue-on-error` from the Trivy step in
`docker-publish.yml`.** Do not reach the same place with `.trivyignore` entries;
suppressing the count is not the same as clearing it.

## Dynamic scanning (DAST)

`dast.yml` builds the image from the tree under test, starts a single container,
and runs an OWASP ZAP baseline against it. Baseline means spider plus passive
checks: ZAP sends no attack traffic.

**The rig is the production compose file, not a separate one.** The workflow runs
`docker compose -p backspace-dast up -d --build --wait backspace`, naming the one
service it wants. That single detail is what keeps the rig small:

- `caddy` sits in the default profile and would hang on ACME without public DNS,
  so it must not be started. Naming `backspace` explicitly is what excludes it.
- `livekit` is already gated behind the `voice` profile and never starts here.
- The compose file publishes no ports for `backspace`, so ZAP joins the compose
  network and addresses the container as `http://backspace:3000`. Nothing is
  reachable on the runner's localhost, and nothing needs to be. The `-p` flag
  fixes the project name, which is what makes the network name
  (`backspace-dast_internal`) deterministic.
- `--wait` blocks on the healthcheck already declared in the compose file, so the
  workflow needs no polling loop.
- A throwaway `.env` is written first, because the service declares
  `env_file: .env` and compose fails outright without it. `DOMAIN` has to be set
  even though `caddy` never starts: compose interpolates the entire file before it
  filters services, and the `caddy` service declares
  `${DOMAIN:?Set DOMAIN in .env}`.

ZAP runs as a plain `docker run` rather than through the marketplace action,
because the target only resolves if the scanner is on the compose network, and
`--network` is a `docker run` flag that the action does not expose.

**What it covers, measured rather than assumed.** The scan is unauthenticated, and
the spider reaches the SPA shell and its static assets only. The measured run
visited 11 URLs: `/`, the JS bundle, three icons, `manifest.webmanifest`, and ZAP's
own probes for `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml`. **None were under `/api/`**, because
the shell contains no links for the spider to follow. Adding explicit seed URLs
would widen this. It has not been done, because the API routes carry the identical
security header set (verified in the same run) and the passive checks would
therefore find nothing new.

Treat the job as proof that the image still builds and the container still becomes
healthy, plus a passive header check on what it reaches. It is not an assessment of
the application. Note also that `/robots.txt` and `/sitemap.xml` return the SPA
shell with HTTP 200, because `setNotFoundHandler` in `packages/server/src/index.ts`
serves `index.html` for every path that is not under `/api/` or `/ws`.

**Advisory, deliberately.** ZAP runs with `-I`, so a finding never fails the job. A
container that will not become healthy does fail it, because that is a real
regression and the reason the job is worth running on every push to `main`.

**Why not on every pull request.** It builds the whole image, which costs minutes
of runner time, and an advisory result does not belong in the merge path. It does
run on pull requests that touch `.github/workflows/dast.yml` or `.zap/**`, so its
own configuration is self-testing.

### Tuned rules

`.zap/rules.tsv` is the only place a rule is downgraded, one line per rule with the
reason inline. `IGNORE` is reserved for findings that are artefacts of scanning the
app container directly instead of the deployed system. Everything else stays at
`WARN`.

| Rule | Alert | Why it is ignored |
|---|---|---|
| 10109 | Modern Web Application | Not a finding. ZAP is reporting that the target is a single-page app and that spider coverage is therefore limited, which is a statement about the scanner rather than about the app. |

Two back-to-back runs against the same live container on 2026-09-03 give the exact
effect of the file. Control, with no rule file:

```
FAIL-NEW: 0  WARN-NEW: 7  IGNORE: 0  PASS: 60
```

Tuned, with `-c /zap/cfg/rules.tsv`:

```
FAIL-NEW: 0  WARN-NEW: 5  IGNORE: 2  PASS: 60
```

**That measurement was taken while the rule file still carried two entries**,
10038 and 10109. 10038 was deleted when the CSP flipped to enforcing on
2026-09-03, because the alert it silenced ("Report-Only Header Found") can no
longer fire for a good reason and silencing it would hide a regression. The
control run is unaffected; the tuned run should now read `IGNORE: 1`, and 10038
should not appear at all. That has not been re-measured, and the next scheduled
DAST run is what will confirm it.

The one moved to `IGNORE` is 10109. The five that stay at `WARN` are 10027,
10049, 10055, 10063 and 90004. Two of those look like candidates for `IGNORE`
and deliberately are not:

- **10055 (CSP directive warnings)** used to evaluate only the narrow enforcing
  policy in the `index.html` meta tag, because the real policy was report-only.
  Since the flip on 2026-09-03 it evaluates the real policy, so its output is now
  worth reading rather than noise. It stays at WARN: `-I` means a warning never
  fails the job.
- **90004 (insufficient site isolation)** is deliberate: `crossOriginEmbedderPolicy`
  is off because embeds pull third-party images that carry no CORP header. That is
  a property of the deployed system, not an artefact of scanning it, so it stays
  visible.

**`Strict-Transport-Security` (rule 10035) is deliberately absent from this file.**
It never fires. ZAP raises it only over HTTPS and this rig is plain HTTP, so the one
header Caddy owns is also the one header ZAP never asks about. It reported `PASS`.
An earlier draft of this document listed it as the main entry; that was a
prediction, and the measured run disproved it. Do not add it back.

**Open finding this scan surfaced, not tuned away:** the app sends no
`Permissions-Policy` header on any route (rule 10063). helmet adds none by default,
and unlike HSTS, Caddy does not supply it either, so a real deployment has the same
gap. It is not fixed here because a wrong value silently breaks voice and screen
sharing, which need `camera`, `microphone` and `display-capture` granted to self.
It belongs with the CSP enforcement flip, which already carries the real-deployment
observation phase a change like this needs.

**The generated reports are not filtered.** The `-c` rule file changes only the
console classification and the exit-code arithmetic. `report.md`, `report.html` and
`report.json` still carry full entries for the ignored rules, so the job summary
built from `report.md` shows them too. The `IGNORE:` count on the console
classification line is the thing to read, not the body of the report.

**The file needs three tab separated columns, not two.** `zap_common.py:148` splits
each line on tabs and raises `ValueError` if it finds fewer than two, and ZAP then
aborts the scan without writing any report at all. The third column is only a
label, so it holds the alert name as ZAP prints it. A space separated line is the
same trap. Check the separators after any edit:

```bash
grep -Pn '^\d+\t(WARN|IGNORE|FAIL)\t' .zap/rules.tsv
```

The trailing `\t` in that pattern is the point: it is what proves a third column
exists. Every non-comment line in the file must match.

## Triage policy

Every finding a scanner reports ends in one of three states: fixed, dismissed with
a written reason, or left open with the reason it is still open. **A dismissal with
no reason is not a dismissal.** The code-scanning API caps `dismissed_comment` at
280 characters, so the comment attached to an alert is a pointer and the register
below is where the argument lives.

### Reachability buckets

Urgency comes from where the affected package ends up, not from the severity string
in the advisory. Four buckets:

| Bucket | Meaning | What it implies |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| **Server image** | Installed into the container self-hosters run (`fastify`, `find-my-way`, `@fastify/static`, `undici`, `drizzle-orm`, `sharp`, `ws`, `better-sqlite3`) | Fix by upgrade, or pin the transitive with `pnpm.overrides`. Highest urgency: reachable from a request. |
| **Web bundle** | Shipped in the JavaScript a browser loads (`react-router`, `nanoid`, PostCSS output) | Same treatment. Reachable from a page load. |
| **Desktop app** | Inside the packaged Electron artifact (`electron` itself, and every runtime `dependencies` entry of `@backspace/desktop`) | Patch within the current major. A major bump is its own decision with its own build evidence. |
| **Build-time only** | Present while building or testing and in no artifact a user receives (`vite`, `rollup`, `vitest`, `@babel/*`, `app-builder-lib`, `extract-zip`, `drizzle-kit`) | Record the reasoning once for the group rather than per finding. Upgrade when convenient, not on an advisory clock. |

**The bucket is measured, not inferred from what the package usually does.**
`pnpm why <package>` is how it is established, and a package is in the shipped
bucket whenever the path from a workspace package runs through a `dependencies`
entry rather than a `devDependencies` one. Three cases where the obvious guess was
wrong:

- **`@babel/preset-env` looks gone and is not.** `@vitejs/plugin-react` 6 dropped
  Babel, which removed `@babel/core` and the JSX transform plugins. Babel is still
  in the tree by another path: `@backspace/web` to `vite-plugin-pwa` to
  `workbox-build` to `@babel/preset-env`. Build-time, but present.
- **`js-yaml` looks like electron-builder tooling.** It arrives that way as well,
  but it also arrives through `electron-updater`, which is a runtime `dependencies`
  entry of `@backspace/desktop`. It ships inside the packaged desktop app.
- **`esbuild` looks build-time and is in two buckets at once.** Version 0.28.2
  arrives through `tsx`, a runtime `dependencies` entry of `@backspace/server`, so
  it is installed into the server image. The 0.18.20 copy, which is the one OSV
  flags, arrives through `drizzle-kit` and is build-time only.

### Measuring the backlog

Three plausible ways of measuring give a wrong answer.

- **`ref=refs/heads/main` reports main's state, not a branch's.** A branch that has
  not merged has changed nothing on main, so this query cannot measure what a pull
  request cleared. Querying `refs/heads/<branch>` returns nothing at all, because
  no analysis is recorded against a branch ref, and `refs/pull/N/merge` reports only
  findings that fall on the changed lines, so a clean PR run means "nothing on this
  diff" rather than "nothing in the repository".
- **A green scanner check is not always a measurement.** Where a scan step still
  carries `continue-on-error: true`, the check passing means the analysis ran and
  the SARIF uploaded, nothing more. Since the enforcement flip in PR #77 that
  applies only to the container image scan in `docker-publish.yml`.
- **`trivy config .` reports more locally than in CI.** Run locally after an install
  it walks `node_modules` and reports DS-0001, DS-0017 and DS-0026 against a
  Dockerfile vendored inside `@surma/rollup-plugin-off-main-thread`. The CI job
  checks out and scans without installing dependencies, so it never sees that file.
  A local reproduction showing extra findings is the expected difference, not a
  regression.

The measurement that does work for dependencies is a local `osv-scanner` run against
each lockfile, validated by reproducing main's count exactly before trusting the
branch's:

```bash
osv-scanner scan source --lockfile=pnpm-lock.yaml --format=json \
  | jq '[.results[].packages[].vulnerabilities[]?] | length'
```

| Lockfile | Findings |
|----------|----------|
| `main` | 151 |
| Dependency branch, after the version bumps, before the transitive pins | 110 |
| Dependency branch, after the transitive pins | 13 |

### The size of the backlog, corrected

The master plan for this security pass estimated 30 lockfile CVEs. The measured
figure on `main` was **189 open alerts** across all tools, of which **151 came from
OSV-Scanner** across **123 distinct advisory identifiers** (120 of which carry a
CVE alias). The rest were 18 CodeQL, 19 Scorecard and 1 Trivy. The estimate was low
by a factor of five, which is why the triage buckets above exist: 151 findings
cannot be worked one at a time.

### What is left open, and why

Twelve OSV findings remain after the dependency pass and the Electron 43 upgrade. Every one needs a major
upgrade that is a separate decision with its own compatibility work, so none of them
is dismissed:

| Package | Findings | Bucket | Fixed in |
|---------|----------|--------|----------|
| `fastify` 4.29.1 | 4 | server image | 5.x |
| `@fastify/static` 7.0.4 | 2 | server image | 10.x |
| `find-my-way` 8.2.2 | 1 | server image | 9.7.0 |
| `react-router` 6.30.6 | 2 | web bundle | 7.18.0 |
| `lodash` 4.17.23 | 2 | build-time (`electron-builder` to `@malept/flatpak-bundler`) | 4.18.0 |
| `esbuild` 0.18.20 | 1 | build-time (`drizzle-kit` to `@esbuild-kit/core-utils`) | 0.25.0 |

## Dismissal register

`.trivyignore` and `.github/codeql/codeql-config.yml` are the machine-readable half
of this. What follows is the half a human reads.

### CodeQL alerts

Six alerts are dismissed. Two are in test files and are also excluded going forward
by the CodeQL config, so they will not recur; the other four are judgements about
shipped code.

**#123 `js/request-forgery`, `packages/server/src/utils/ssrf.ts:70`, dismissed as a
false positive.** This is the `fetch` inside `safeFetch`, one line after
`await validateExternalUrl(currentUrl)`. It carries seven converging dataflow paths,
which are its seven callers: the SSRF work collapsed seven separately-flagged sinks
into one choke point, and CodeQL flags the choke point because a validator living in
another module is not something it models as a sanitizer. Redirects are followed
manually and every hop is revalidated before it is fetched, so there is no path to
this line that skipped the check.

**This one names a residual risk rather than claiming the alert is pure noise.**
`validateExternalUrl` resolves the hostname and classifies the resulting address,
and then `fetch` resolves the hostname again when it connects. A name whose answer
changes between the two lookups is fetched on the second answer, which the validator
never saw. That is a DNS-rebind time-of-check-to-time-of-use window. Closing it
needs a custom undici dispatcher that pins the address resolved during validation
and connects to that address rather than re-resolving. That is out of scope for the
work that produced this dismissal and is not fixed. The window is narrow and the
dismissal is still the right call for this alert, because the alert is about taint
flow and not about rebinding, but the residual is real and is recorded in the
function comment at the call site as well as here.

**#217 `js/clear-text-storage-of-sensitive-data`, `packages/web/src/stores/authStore.ts:116`,
dismissed as won't fix.** The session token is in `localStorage` deliberately. That
choice is the premise the instance CORS posture and the security-header split rest
on, and it is written up with its cost in `docs/systems/web-security.md`. Moving the
token is a decision for that document and a change to how the origin is trusted, not
a defect in this line.

**#130 `js/shell-command-injection-from-environment`, `packages/server/src/utils/backup.ts:50`,
dismissed as won't fix.** The call is
`execFile('/bin/sh', ['-c', `${cmd} "$1"`, 'sh', snapshotPath])`, where `cmd` is
`config.backup.offsiteCmd`, a server environment variable. Anyone who can set it
already controls the process the server runs in, so it names an operator rather than
an attacker. The one value that is not operator-supplied, the snapshot path, is
passed positionally as `$1` and quoted at the use site rather than concatenated into
the command text. No request reaches this function.

**#124 `js/insecure-randomness`, `packages/web/src/components/ui/Avatar.tsx:57`,
dismissed as a false positive.** `getAvatarGradient` in `packages/web/src/utils/gradients.ts`
contains no randomness at all. It is a djb2 hash of the account id or name, taken
modulo the number of presets, so an account renders the same fallback colour on
every device and every reload. It selects one of seven decorative gradients and
feeds nothing with an identity or uniqueness requirement.

**#348 `js/shell-command-injection-from-environment`, `packages/server/test/cors-posture.test.ts:66`,
and #106 `js/missing-rate-limiting`, `packages/server/src/routes/federation/handlers/s2sAuth.test.ts:75`,
both dismissed as used in tests.** Each reports the test doing the thing the test
exists to prove. See the CodeQL config below.

### CodeQL config: test files are not analysed

`.github/codeql/codeql-config.yml` sets `paths-ignore` over `**/*.test.ts`,
`**/*.test.tsx`, `packages/server/test/**` and `packages/web/src/test/**`, and
`codeql.yml` passes it to the `init` step. Before that file existed there was no
CodeQL config at all, which is why test code was being analysed.

Test files model attacker behaviour on purpose. A suite that proves a route is rate
limited contains an unlimited-request loop, and one that boots a server from the
environment contains an exec built from the environment. Analysing them produces
findings about the tests rather than about what ships, and those findings crowd out
the ones that matter.

The exclusion is safe because every listed path holds test code only: no file under
`packages/*/src` that ships to a user is named `*.test.ts` or `*.test.tsx`,
`packages/server/test` holds the suite helpers and the vitest environment setup, and
`packages/web/src/test` holds the jsdom setup file. Verify that again before adding
a path to the list.

### Trivy config: DS-0002

`.trivyignore` suppresses one rule, DS-0002, "Specify at least 1 USER command in
Dockerfile with non-root user". The `trivy-config` job names the file explicitly
with `trivyignores: .trivyignore` rather than relying on the default working
directory.

The image has no `USER` line on purpose. `docker-entrypoint.sh` runs as root only
long enough to chown the mounted data volume, then execs the CMD as the
unprivileged `node` user. A `USER` directive would take effect before the entrypoint
runs and leave the volume unwritable on first start. The container does not run its
workload as root; the check reads the Dockerfile and cannot see the entrypoint.

This was re-verified against the current `node:24-slim` base rather than carried
over from the note written against the old Node 20 base. A container started from a
fresh build reports Uid 1000 for pid 1, and `trivy config Dockerfile` against the
current file reports DS-0002 and nothing else.

### Scorecard: the TokenPermissions findings that stay

Nine `TokenPermissionsID` findings were reported. Each write scope was either
removed or moved from workflow level onto the single job that makes the call needing
it, with a comment at each surviving grant saying which API call requires it.

**Moving a write down to the job level does not clear the finding in general.** This
is not a guess; it is what `ossf/scorecard` v5.4.0 does in
`checks/raw/permissions.go` and `checks/evaluation/permissions.go`:

- Only seven scopes are examined at all: `statuses`, `checks`, `security-events`,
  `deployments`, `contents`, `packages`, `actions`. `pages`, `id-token`,
  `pull-requests` and `issues` are never reported, at either level.
- **Top-level writes are reported unconditionally.** `validateTopLevelPermissions`
  passes an empty ignore map, so no matcher can excuse a workflow-level write.
- **Job-level writes are ignored only for three scopes, and only on a match.**
  `createIgnoredPermissions` can excuse `security-events` when a step uses
  `github/codeql-action/analyze`, `github/codeql-action/upload-sarif`,
  `ossf/scorecard-action`, `haskell-actions/hlint-scan` or
  `zizmorcore/zizmor-action`; `packages` when the workflow matches a packaging
  matcher, one of which is `docker/build-push-action`; and `contents` only for a
  fixed list of release tooling (`python-semantic-release`, an
  `npx|pnpm|yarn semantic-release` run, `setup-go` plus `goreleaser-action`, the two
  SLSA generator workflows, an `mvn release:prepare` run) or for a GitHub Pages
  deployment using `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages`.
- **`actions`, `statuses`, `checks` and `deployments` are never ignored at job
  level.** No matcher can excuse them.

Applying that rule to the workflows as they now stand, the findings expected to
survive are:

| Workflow | Scope | Why it stays granted |
|----------|-------|----------------------|
| `metrics.yml` | `contents: write` | The collector commits the day's traffic rows to the `metrics-data` branch. Not a release or a `peaceiris` deploy, so no matcher applies. |
| `metrics.yml` | `actions: write` | Required by the `gh workflow enable` step. GitHub disables a scheduled workflow after 60 days of repository inactivity, and that step is what resets the clock. Removing this scope loses data silently, months later. It is **not** for the reusable-workflow call, which needs no such scope. |
| `backfill.yml` | `contents: write` | Same data-branch write as the collector. |
| `cla.yml` | `contents: write` | `contributor-assistant/github-action` commits `signatures/cla.json` to the `cla-signatures` branch. |
| `cla.yml` | `actions: write` | The same action calls `actions.reRunWorkflow` to re-run the last failed CLA run once a signature comment arrives. |
| `release.yml` | `contents: write` | electron-builder runs with `--publish always`, which creates the release for the tag and uploads the installers. electron-builder is not on Scorecard's release-tooling list, so the matcher does not fire. |

`docker-publish.yml`'s `packages: write` and `security-events: write` and every
`security-events: write` in `codeql.yml`, `security.yml` and `scorecard.yml` do
clear, because those workflows match the packaging and SARIF matchers above.
`cla.yml`'s `statuses: write` was removed outright: the pinned revision of the
action calls no commit-status endpoint. Check that again before moving the pin.

These six are the correct trade. Each is load-bearing, each is commented at the
grant, and Scorecard reporting them is the tool working as designed rather than a
gap. Do not remove one to raise the score.

The Scorecard checks that no code change satisfies (`CIIBestPracticesID`,
`FuzzingID`, `CodeReviewID`, `BranchProtectionID`, `SecurityPolicyID`) are maintainer
settings or process. They belong to the checklist below, not to remediation.

## Supply-chain hardening

- Every action is pinned to a full commit SHA (`# vX.Y.Z` comment) — resists
  tag-move attacks and satisfies Scorecard's Pinned-Dependencies check.
  **One `uses:` is deliberately unpinned and cannot be pinned:**
  `metrics.yml`'s `uses: ./.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`. GitHub rejects
  `@ref` on a `./` path and resolves a local reusable workflow from the calling
  run's own commit, which is tighter than a SHA pin. Not a gap — do not "fix" it.
- `step-security/harden-runner` (egress-policy `audit`) on every workflow in
  `.github/workflows/`. Two jobs deliberately go without it, and neither is a gap:
  `ci.yml`'s `build-and-test-required`, which only compares a `needs` result and
  makes no network call, and `metrics.yml`'s `deploy-dashboard`, which is a call
  into the local reusable `deploy-pages.yml` whose own job is hardened. In
  `release.yml` the step is gated on `runner.os == 'Linux'`, because harden-runner
  does not support the macOS and Windows legs of the build matrix.
- Least-privilege `permissions:` per workflow/job.
- SBOM + SLSA provenance are attached to the published container image at push
  (`.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml`), alongside a report-only Trivy scan
  of the amd64 image (the arm64 image ships unscanned; enforcement is turned
  on in a later plan).
- `cloudflare/wrangler-action` is pinned at `9acf94ac` (v3.15.0), the head of
  the v3 line, in `telemetry-receiver.yml`. It is used twice in the same job and
  both uses carry the same pin. It is the only action in the repository that
  carries a credential to a service outside GitHub, so it is the one whose pin
  matters most: a moved tag there would run attacker code holding a live
  Cloudflare API token.

### The telemetry receiver workflow

`telemetry-receiver.yml` is the only workflow that deploys to an account outside
GitHub, and the only one whose tests do not run in Node. What guards it:

- **Secrets are unreachable from a merge.** The `deploy` job requires
  `github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch'`, `github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'`
  and `!github.event.repository.fork`, all three. `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and
  `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` are scoped to the `telemetry-receiver` environment
  rather than to the repository, so no other job can read them even by mistake.
  The `test` job reads no secret at all, which is why it is safe to run on
  pull requests from forks.
- **The job creates nothing.** The D1 database, the `EXPORT_TOKEN` Worker secret
  and the custom domain are provisioned by hand once. The job applies migrations
  that are already in the repository and publishes the Worker. See
  [telemetry.md](telemetry.md) section 8.
- **The tests run inside Cloudflare's workerd**, started by
  `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`, not in Node. That is a second runtime,
  pulled from npm as part of the install and executing the Worker for real
  rather than a mock of it. `ci.yml`'s `pnpm -r test` runs this package too, so
  the runtime is already exercised on both Node legs of the main pipeline; this
  workflow adds the path-filtered check and the deploy.
- **This workflow reads `.nvmrc` (24), not the `engines.node` floor of 20.**
  `wrangler` and `miniflare` both declare `engines.node: ">=22.0.0"`. The suite
  passes on Node 20 today, and `ci.yml`'s matrix keeps testing it there, but the
  `deploy` job runs wrangler against the live account and should not be the
  place a version below Cloudflare's declared floor first misbehaves.
- **`permissions: contents: read`** at workflow level and nothing added at job
  level. The `environment:` key needs no scope of its own.

## Maintainer checklist (one-time GitHub settings — NOT code)

Status verified against the live repository on 2026-09-03 (`gh api`). These are
settings, not code, so nothing in this repository keeps the boxes honest — re-check
them when something in the Security tab looks wrong, and after any transfer or
rename.

### Done

- [x] Repository is **public** (required for the Scorecard badge/publish and the
      CodeQL free tier).
- [x] Fine-grained PAT scoped to this repository only, with **Administration:
      read** and **Contents: read**, stored as the `METRICS_TOKEN` repository
      secret. Traffic endpoints are unreachable without it — there is no
      `administration` key in the Actions `permissions:` vocabulary, so
      `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot substitute. See `docs/systems/metrics.md` §7.
- [x] **Dependabot alerts** enabled (`PUT /repos/{owner}/{repo}/vulnerability-alerts`,
      confirmed by `GET` returning 204 where it previously returned 404). The
      repository had been running OSV-Scanner while GitHub's own advisory feed was
      switched off.
- [x] **Dependabot security updates left off**, deliberately.
      `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/automated-security-fixes` reports
      `{"enabled":false,"paused":false}`. Enabling it means Dependabot opens pull
      requests by itself for every new advisory. Clearing the backlog above took a
      dedicated pass, so advisories now surface as alerts while the pull-request
      queue stays under human control. Revisit once the remainder is down to
      packages that can be bumped without a compatibility review.
- [x] Ruleset on the `metrics-data` branch blocking **deletion** and
      **force-push**, with no bypass actors (`Protect metrics data store`,
      alongside the `Protect CLA signature store` precedent it copies). It
      deliberately does **not** require pull requests or status checks: the
      collector commits directly, and requiring a PR would break every run. This
      branch holds the only irreplaceable data in the repository.
- [x] Settings → Actions → General: **Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve
      pull requests** enabled (`can_approve_pull_request_reviews: true` on
      `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/permissions/workflow`; the default
      workflow token permission stays **read**). The `update-flatpak-metadata`
      job in `release.yml` opens the `automation/flatpak-<tag>` pull request
      with `GITHUB_TOKEN`, which GitHub rejects while this is off. It was off
      when the v1.0.6 chain first ran (2026-09-04) and was turned on before the
      re-run. Every job still declares its own `permissions:` block, so this
      widens nothing for jobs that do not ask for `pull-requests: write`.

### Outstanding

- [ ] Settings → Code security: enable **Secret scanning** + **Push protection**.
      Both currently disabled — note that `security.yml`'s gitleaks job scans full
      history on PR and push, but it is not push protection and cannot stop a
      secret from landing.
- [ ] Settings → Code security: enable **CodeQL / code-scanning merge protection**
      so high-severity alerts block PRs (the code-level gates do the rest). No
      code-scanning rule is present on any ruleset today.
- [ ] Branch protection on `main`: **partly done.** The `Require CI on main`
      ruleset is active and blocks deletion and force-push, requires a pull
      request, and requires the `Build & test` check. It does **not** require any
      check from `security.yml`, `codeql.yml`, or `scorecard.yml` — add those
      contexts when enforcement is turned on, or the tiered policy above has no
      gate on `main`.
- [ ] Settings → Code security: enable **Secret scanning validity checks**.
      Currently disabled. It asks the provider whether a detected credential is
      still live, which is the difference between an alert and an incident.
- [ ] The five Scorecard checks that are maintainer settings or process rather than
      code, and therefore cannot be fixed from a pull request: `Branch-Protection`,
      `CII-Best-Practices`, `Code-Review`, `Fuzzing`, `Security-Policy`.
      `Security-Policy` was expected to resolve once `SECURITY.md` documented the
      testing pipeline. **It did not.** Measured after the Scorecard run on
      `16828e99`, which is the commit that added that section: the finding is
      still open. The check scores the file's contents rather than its existence,
      so more prose does not move it on its own. Investigate what it actually
      wants before assuming the next edit will clear it. `Code-Review` reflects
      commits reaching `main` without a reviewed pull request, which is inherent
      to a single-maintainer repository.
- [ ] **Cloudflare deploy secrets.** `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and
      `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` on the `telemetry-receiver` environment, plus a
      branch policy on that environment allowing `main` only. The API token
      should be scoped to editing Workers and D1 on that one account, not to an
      account-wide edit. Until they exist a dispatched deploy fails at the
      wrangler step; nothing else in the repository is affected.
- [ ] **Manual image bumps:** Dependabot does not track `docker-compose.yml`
      `image:` pins — update `caddy` and `livekit/livekit-server` by hand when new
      releases ship. (Renovate, which parses compose, is an optional future
      alternative.) Standing task, never "done".
